# Jitter
 Some programs I built and put together for those who have the urge to do some of these, or just simply want to use them.

# Usage
You must have Node.js installed, if you don't, download it from here: https://nodejs.org/en/download/. Once done, run the start.sh file to begin.

# Notes
For the purchase simulator program, don't think I am trying to get your card details, random numbers are meant to be inputted like so: Card Numbers, (xxxxxxxxxxxx) 12 characters long, CVV, (xxx) 3 characters long, Expiration date, xx/xx, all of the "x" are substitution for numbers. Do not put real card details in for your own safety. The text waterfall program is somewhat flashy, so if you are epileptic, please be warned.

# Copying
Feel free to copy and take anything from this code, you don't have to credit anybody if you do so.
